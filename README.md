Project Description
An Android app that sends alert messages and makes your phone vibrate for extreme weather conditions‚Ä¶ on other planets like Mars, Jupiter, and beyond. Because who doesn‚Äôt want to know about a Martian dust storm while eating breakfast?

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Humans live on Earth, yet tragically remain uninformed about interplanetary weather events. What if there‚Äôs a cyclone on Jupiter and you miss it? That‚Äôs a once-in-a-lifetime gossip topic gone forever.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a mobile app that notifies you with alerts and phone vibrations whenever weather events like cyclones, rain, or storms occur on other planets. Finally, you can panic about extraterrestrial drizzle without leaving your couch.

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Languages used: Kotlin

Frameworks used: Android SDK

Libraries used: Android Jetpack components, Retrofit (for fetching planetary ‚Äúweather‚Äù), Notification APIs, Vibration APIs

Tools used: Android Studio, Gradle

For Hardware:
Main components: Any Android smartphone capable of vibration

Specifications: Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher recommended

Tools required: Just your phone (and a serious lack of real problems to solve)

Implementation
For Software:
Installation
Install Android Studio from developer.android.com/studio.

During setup, install the Android SDK and select the required SDK platforms (API 26+ recommended).

Install Kotlin support (usually included in recent Android Studio versions).

Install necessary Android packages and tools via SDK Manager inside Android Studio.
