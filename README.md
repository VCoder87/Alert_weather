### Project Description
An Android app that sends alert messages and makes your phone vibrate for extreme weather conditions‚Ä¶ on other planets like Mars, Jupiter, and beyond. Because who doesn‚Äôt want to know about a Martian dust storm while eating breakfast?


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We built a mobile app that notifies you with alerts and phone vibrations whenever weather events like cyclones, rain, or storms occur on other planets. Finally, you can panic about extraterrestrial drizzle without leaving your couch.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

## Technical Details
We built a mobile app that notifies you with alerts and phone vibrations whenever weather events like cyclones, rain, or storms occur on other planets. Finally, you can panic about extraterrestrial drizzle without leaving your couch.
